# Image classification & multimodal embedding pipeline (optional feature)

This project demonstrates a full deep learning workflow using ResNet, followed by an experimental extension into multimodal modeling.

It begins as a standard image classification task and evolves into a representation-learning pipeline where image embeddings are extracted and fused with structured tabular data. The goal is not to maximize a single accuracy score, but to show how to build, evaluate, diagnose, and extend an ML system.
