# House price prediction – Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using a basic linear regression model to predict house prices.

**Highlights:**
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Train/test split  
- Linear regression model with scikit-learn  
- Evaluation using R² and RMSE  

The model achieves:
- R² = 0.89  
- RMSE ≈ 25,600  

Datasets were retireved from Kaggle.com. Also included in the folder a separate test dataset for submission to Kaggle (if interested).
